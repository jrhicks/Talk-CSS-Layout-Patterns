CSS LAYOUT PATTERNS EXAMPLE
===========

This repository has some CSS exercises to go along with a presentation at http://jrhicks.github.io/#/content/ui-principles

The HTML & CSS Selectors have been left in-tact for the following final product.  Except
the style rules have been redacted to provide an opportunity for the student to practice.
